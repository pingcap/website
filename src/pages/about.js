            <p className="paragraph">
              PingCAP started in 2015 when three seasoned infrastructure
              engineers were sick and tired of the way databases were managed,
              scaled, and maintained while working at leading Internet
              companies. Seeing no good solution on the market, they decided to
              build one themselves--the open-source way.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph">
              With the help of a first-class team and hundreds of contributors
              from around the globe, PingCAP is building an open source
              distributed NewSQL hybrid transactional and analytical processing
              (HTAP) database. Its flagship project, TiDB, is a cloud-native
              distributed SQL layer with MySQL compatibility, and one of the
              most popular open source database projects in the world (don’t
              take our word for it, check it out:
              https://github.com/pingcap/tidb). TiDB’s sister project, TiKV, is
              a cloud-native distributed Key-Value store. It is now a CNCF
              incubating project .
