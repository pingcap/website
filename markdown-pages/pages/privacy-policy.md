## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Information you provide directly. We collect and store personal information that you directly provide us through our Site, when using our Products, and other ways, such as through a customer support request, through interactions on social media, participation in a survey or promotion, application for a job, when downloading white papers on our Sites, and at events. Information we collect includes, for example,

- **Contact information:** your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, billing address,and user names.
- **Demographic data:** your job title, company name, city, state, and country.
- **Content and communications:** any data you enter into any ‘free text’ boxes on our forms, comments in our chat forms, and communications with us on social media and other platforms (like GitHub and Twitter), through phone, or messaging services (like Slack).
- **Payment information:** your credit card numbers and other payment information. Our third party payment processors (like Stripe) collect this information if you purchase our Products, such as online training, cloud services, or software subscriptions.

**Information collected automatically.** As further described in the “Our Use of Cookies and Other Technologies” and “Product telemetry data” sections below, we and our third-party partners automatically collect certain types of device and usage information when you use our Sites or Products. Information we collect includes, for example:

- **Geolocation data:** Depending on your device settings, we collect geolocation data when you visit our Sites and use our Products. For example, we may derive your general location using IP address
- **Identifiers and device information:** When you visit our Site, your device’s operating system, device identifier, customer ID and other device information, user agent string, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type, and log data detailing your interactions with our Site (e.g., number of clicks, pages viewed, information searched for), and the website you visited before and after coming to our Site (i.e., referrer header) are logged automatically. When you submit a support ticket, we receive data from the user agent string of your browser, which includes device information, browser information, OS information, city, state, country, and IP address

We may combine this information with information you provide when you download our Products or provide to customer support, including the name of your organization or company.

When we collect product telemetry data , we take appropriate steps to pseudonymise the IP addresses before it is stored . We employ technical and organizational measures to prevent the reconstitution of IP addresses or reversal of pseudonymization that would allow attribution of the data to a specific individual, including segregating or not collecting any additional information that may be used for attribution. We store the pseudonymized data for 2 years

The resulting pseudonymised data is used by us on behalf of our customers to (i) maintain and improve TiDB products, and (ii) inform users whether they are running the latest version of PingCAP products.

We collect several data within product telemetry data as below :

## HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Storage and processing.** Your information collected through the Sites and our Products may be stored and processed in any country in which PingCAP or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities including your region, the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom). Our processing locations are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Statement is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Statement and applicable law wherever the data is located.

**International data transfers.** When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom) and from Switzerland to the United States or other countries which have not been determined by the European Commission to have laws that provide an adequate level of data protection, we use legal mechanisms, including contracts, designed to help ensure your rights and protections. Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States and our affiliates, partners, third parties and service providers operate in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada, and Australia. This means when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement. The safeguard PingCAP primarily relies upon is the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses. For more information about these mechanisms, please contact us using the contact details provided in the “How to contact us” section below.

**Keeping your information safe.** PingCAP cares about the security of your information and takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or your information.

**Lawful basis for processing personal information (EEA only).** If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), PingCAP, Inc., is the data controller of your information.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will indicate this at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences, if any, if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will indicate to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about the legal basis for processing or want to find out more please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Statement.

**Retention.** We retain personal information for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, we retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Products you have requested or authorized, including maintaining and improving the performance of the Products and protecting system security. We also retain personal data as needed to maintain appropriate business and financial records, protect our legal interests, resolve disputes, or comply with legal or regulatory requirements. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information using appropriate security measures and take appropriate steps designed to isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS

If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:

- You may request access to, and correction or erasure of, personal information
- If automated processing of your personal data is based on a contract with you or your consent, you have certain rights to data portability
- If the processing of personal information is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing
- You have a right to object to, or obtain a restriction of, the processing of personal information under certain circumstances.
  To make such requests, contact us by email at the address below. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns.

## CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), provides California residents with the following rights:

Right to know and right to delete. You may request a copy of the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed, and sold about you over the past twelve (12) months. We identify the categories of personal information we collect, the purposes for collection, the sources of personal information, and any information disclosed and shared in this Privacy Statement. You may also request that we delete certain personal information we have about you. You may “request to know” or “request to delete” your personal information by contacting us at legal@pingcap.com. Please know that any such request is subject to our ability to verify your identity and any exceptions provided under applicable laws.

Right to opt out. As discussed in this Privacy Statement, our advertising and analytics providers may collect your IP address, cookie ID, and mobile ID when you use our websites, and such vendors may further share your information to provide similar advertising or analytics services to their other customers. PingCAP does not generally sell information as the terms “sale” or “sell” are traditionally understood. However, making a California resident’s personal information (including IP addresses, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs) available to third parties as described above may broadly be considered a “sale” under the CCPA. You can opt-out of third party tracking on our websites as described in our Cookie Notice.

PingCAP may modify or update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, and so you should review this page periodically.
