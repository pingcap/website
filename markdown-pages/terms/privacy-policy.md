## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Information you provide directly**. We collect and store personal information that you directly provide us through our Site, when using our Products, and other ways, such as:

- Completing a customer support request;
- Interacting with us on social media;
- Participating in a survey or promotion;
- Applying for a job;
- Downloading white papers on our Sites; and
- Registering for events held by PingCAP and via our Site.

Information we collect includes, for example,

- **Contact information**: your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, billing address, and usernames.
- **Demographic data**: your job title, company name, city, state, and country.
- **Content and communications**: any data you enter into any ‘free text’ boxes on our forms, comments in our chat forms, and communications with us on social media and other platforms (like GitHub and Twitter), through phone, or messaging services (like Slack) (“User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
- **Payment information**: your credit card numbers and other payment information. Our third-party payment processors (like Stripe) collect this information if you purchase our Products, such as online training, cloud services, or software subscriptions.

**Information collected automatically**. As further described in the "Our Use of Cookies and Other Technologies", "TiDB product telemetry data" and "TiDB Cloud operational data" sections below, we and our third-party partners automatically collect certain types of device and usage information when you use our Sites or Products. Information we collect includes, for example:

- **Geolocation data**: Depending on your device settings, we may collect geolocation data when you visit our Sites and use our Products. For example, we may derive your general location using your IP address.
- **Identifiers and device information**: When you visit our Site, your device’s operating system, device identifier, customer ID and other device information, user agent string, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type, and log data detailing your interactions with our Sites (e.g., number of clicks, pages viewed, information searched for), and the website you visited before and after coming to our Site (i.e., referrer header) are logged automatically. When you submit a support ticket, we receive data from the user agent string of your browser, which includes device information, browser information, OS information, city, state, country, and IP address.

**TiDB Product telemetry data (for TiDB and its relevant products and services only; referred as "TiDB Products")**. When you use our TiDB Products, we may also collect certain TiDB telemetry data and other data about your usage, including your IP address and other unique identifiers in combination with information about the version of our software you are running and how it is configured, to collect and aggregate certain diagnostic and analytics information. We may combine this information with information you provide when you download our TiDB Products or provide to customer support, including the name of your organization or company.

When we collect TiDB product telemetry data, we take appropriate steps to pseudonymize the IP addresses before it is stored. We employ technical and organizational measures to prevent the reconstitution of IP addresses or reversal of pseudonymization that would allow attribution of the data to a specific individual, including segregating or not collecting any additional information that may be used for attribution. We store the pseudonymized data for 2 years.

The resulting pseudonymized data is used by us on behalf of our customers to (i) maintain and improve TiDB Products, and (ii) inform users whether they are running the latest version of TiDB Products.

We collect several data within TiDB telemetry data as below:

- TiDB Products cluster related hardware information
- TiDB Products cluster topology information
- TiDB Products cluster software version information
- TiDB Products cluster configuration information (only the config items, config values are excluded)
- TiDB Products cluster components information
- TiDB Products cluster maintenance operation consumed time
- TiDB Products cluster usage and runtime metrics

**TiDB Cloud operational data (for TiDB Cloud only)**. When you use TiDB Cloud, we may automatically collect and store non-anonymized information and data about your operation of TiDB Cloud, including logs, metrics and the service tickets submitted to TiDB Cloud. Although the operational data usually does not involve personal information, it may be linked to your account and include the following information, data and metadata:

- Technical information obtained from APIs, software or system hosting TiDB Cloud and your computer or device, and log files generated during your operation of TiDB Cloud;
- Data and metadata about you, such as your account, email, IP address, computer or other device, browser, and software; and
- Data and metadata about your activities and behavior within TiDB Cloud.

**Inferences**. We infer new information about you and your company from data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences, your service and product needs or other characteristics. For example, we infer your city, state, and country location based on your IP address.

**Information collected through social media and other platforms**. We receive information about you when you engage with us through various third-party platforms, for example, by joining our Slack community or Google group, liking us on Facebook, connecting on LinkedIn, GitHub, or Meetup, following us on Twitter or Instagram, registering for training through WooCommerce, or sharing content from our Site on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. The data we exchange with these third-party platforms may depend upon your privacy settings with these platforms. You should review and consider adjusting your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before engaging. Do not provide us with any sensitive personal data through these platforms. We are not responsible for the data protection and use practices of these third-party platforms. Please see their privacy policies to learn how they use your information.

**Third-party sources**. We may occasionally receive your personal information from third party sources including our affiliates, marketing and research partners, and companies. Users of our Products may also provide your personal information when they identify you as a billing, support, or technical contact, or when inviting you to use our Products or attend our events. If you integrate or link a third-party service with our Sites or Products, we may receive personal information about you from that third-party service based upon the settings and permissions you've established with such third-party service, and that third-party service's privacy practices.

The types of information we collect from third parties may include contact information, demographic data, and content and communications. We use this information to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you, identify new customers, and provide a more tailored advertising experience. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you through our Sites and Products.

When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary to provide certain Products, those Products or certain of their capabilities may not be available or function correctly.

We are not responsible for the data policies and procedures or content of any third parties. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of each website you visit.

## YOUR CHOICES ABOUT PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Access, correction, or deletion**. If you wish to request access, correction, or deletion of any of your personal information held by us or a change in the way we use your information (for which we reserve the right to charge you a fee, as permitted by applicable law), please submit your request here or by email to info@pingap.com. However, we may decline requests that are unreasonable, prohibited by law, or are not required to be honored by applicable law.

**How to control your communications preferences**. You can stop receiving promotional emails from us by clicking on the "unsubscribe link" provided in such emails or by contacting us at the contact details set forth below. In addition, you can make changes to your preferences in our Preference Center. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. If you opt out, we may still send you transactional communications (e.g., non-promotional emails such as emails about training and events you registered to attend and technical or security notices).

**Cookies**. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Site or other Products. Other choices related to information collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies are described in the "Cookies" section above. For specific opt out links and to manage your preferences in relation to first- and third-party cookies please see our Cookie Notice.

**How to control collection of TiDB telemetry data**. If you prefer that we do not collect certain TiDB telemetry data, including IP address, through TiDB tools - TiUP, you can manage the collection of this data as follows:

- By using `tiup telemetry disable` to turn off and disable collecting telemetry data.
- By using `tiup telemetry enable` to turn on and enable collecting telemetry data.
- By using `tiup telemetry reset` to reset the collecting function and generate a new unique tracing identifier.
- By using `tiup telemetry status` to verify the status (on/off) of the collecting function.

**Do Not Track.** There are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms (for example, "Do Not Track") can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and, while we and others give you choices described in this Privacy Policy, we do not currently honor these mechanisms.

## HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Storage and processing.** Your information collected through the Sites and our Products may be stored and processed in any country in which PingCAP or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities including your region, the United States, Australia, Canada, China, and the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom). Our processing locations are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable law wherever the data is located.

**International data transfers.** When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom) and from Switzerland to the United States or other countries which have not been determined by the European Commission to have laws that provide an adequate level of data protection, we use legal mechanisms, including contracts, designed to help ensure your rights and protections. Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States and our affiliates, partners, third parties and service providers operate in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada, China, and Australia. This means when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries. However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The safeguard PingCAP primarily relies upon is the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses. For more information about these mechanisms, please contact us using the contact details provided in the "How to contact us" section below.

**Keeping your information safe.** PingCAP cares about the security of your information and takes reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or your information.

**Lawful basis for processing personal information (EEA only).** If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland, PingCAP (US), Inc., is the data controller of your information.

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will indicate this at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences, if any, if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), we will indicate to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about the legal basis for processing or want to find out more, please contact us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**Retention.** We retain personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed and for longer periods as necessary for us to comply with applicable laws. For example, we retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Products you have requested or authorized, including maintaining and improving the performance of the Products and protecting system security. We also retain personal data as needed to maintain appropriate business and financial records, protect our legal interests, resolve disputes, or comply with legal or regulatory requirements. Thereafter, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will store your personal information using appropriate security measures and take appropriate steps designed to isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS

If the processing of personal data about you is subject to European Union data protection law, you have certain rights with respect to that data:

- You may request access to, and correction or erasure of, personal information. We are not obliged to delete your data if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
- You have the right to restrict our processing where you believe your personal data is inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose (unless we are unable to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it).
- Where the legal justification for our processing of personal data is our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to processing on grounds relating to your particular situation.
  If we are processing your personal data on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you, you have the right to data portability.
- If the processing of personal information is based on your consent, you have a right to withdraw consent at any time for future processing, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. This includes cases where you wish to opt out of marketing messages sent by us.

To make a request to exercise these rights, contact us by email at the address below. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us with any questions or concerns. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA are available [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en), United Kingdom [here](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/) and Switzerland [here](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/links/data-protection---switzerland.html).
