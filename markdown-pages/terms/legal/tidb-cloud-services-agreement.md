You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary depending on the volume of your usage of the TiDB Cloud Services and that we may bill you more frequently for fees accrued in our discretion, including if we believe there is a risk of non-payment or suspect that your account may be fraudulent. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and must be paid without setoff or deduction, and all amounts paid are non-refundable.

If PingCAP has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which you are responsible under this Section 4.3, PingCAP will invoice you and you will pay that amount to PingCAP. Taxes will not be deducted from payments to PingCAP, except as required by applicable Law, in which case you will increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, PingCAP receives and retains an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Upon PingCAP's request, you will provide to PingCAP your proof of withholding tax remittance to the respective taxing authority. Also, you will reimburse PingCAP for reasonable expenses related to providing the TiDB Cloud Services, such as the transaction fees charged by banks in the process of your payment to PingCAP. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all fees and expenses paid to PingCAP are non-refundable.</span>

## 8. Indemnification

<div class="customize-indentation">

- 8.1. <span>**Indemnity by PingCAP**. PingCAP will (a) defend you from and against any claim initiated by a third party alleging that the TiDB Cloud Services or your use thereof in accordance with this CSA infringes such third party's IP Rights and (b) indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) awarded against you or agreed in settlement by us arising out of or result from such the third-party claim; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any such claim to the extent arising from your use of the TiDB Cloud Services in combination with any other software, service or technology not provided by PingCAP. Should the TiDB Cloud Services become or, in PingCAP's reasonable opinion be likely to become, the subject of any such claim, PingCAP may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for you the right to continue to use the TiDB Cloud Services as contemplated by this CSA; (ii) replace or modify the TiDB Cloud Services to render its use in accordance with this CSA non-infringing; or (iii) with thirty (30) days' notice to you, terminate this CSA and refund to you, in the same currency that the fees were paid by you, any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term after the termination date.</span>

- 8.2. <span>**Indemnity by You**. You will (a) defend PingCAP from and against any claim by a third party arising from or relating to: (i) Your Content, including its use and any combination of Your Content with other software, services, technology, data or processes, including any such claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP Rights; (ii) your use of the TiDB Cloud Services (including any activities under your account and any use thereof by your employees and personnel); (iii) any product, service or technology used by you in connection with or related to the TiDB Cloud Services; or (iv) any breach of this CSA or violation of applicable Law by you, in each case of (i)-(iv), to the extent that such third-party claim is not subject to PingCAP's indemnity obligations in Section 8.1 and (b) indemnify and hold PingCAP harmless from and against any liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) awarded against PingCAP or agreed in settlement by you arising out of or resulting from such the third-party claim.</span>

- 8.3. <span>**Indemnity Procedures**. In the event of any potential indemnity obligation under this Section 8, the indemnified party will: (a) promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the third-party claim in accordance with Section 15.5; (b) provide the indemnifying party with sole control and authority over the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim at the indemnifying party's sole cost and expense; and (c) upon request of the indemnifying party, and at the indemnifying party's expense, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by the indemnifying party. Failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of a claim under this Section 8 shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section 8 except to the extent that the indemnifying party was actually prejudiced by such delay or failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section 8.3. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim that would bind the indemnified party to any obligation (other than payment covered by the indemnifying party or ceasing to use infringing materials) or require any admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the indemnified party's prior written consent, which consent is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any indemnification obligation under this Section 8 will not apply if the indemnified party settles or makes any admission with respect to a claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent.</span>

- 8.4. <span>This Section 8 states the indemnifying party's sole liability to, and the indemnified party's exclusive remedy against, the other party for any type of claim described in this Section 8.</span>

</div>

## 11. Nondisclosure

<div class="customize-indentation">

- 11.1. <span>PingCAP and you may have access to Confidential Information of the other party. Each party agrees to use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidentiality of similar nature (but not less than a reasonable degree of care) to not (a) use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose other than in connection with the provision or use, as applicable, of the TiDB Cloud Services and (b) except as otherwise agreed by the disclosing party, disclose the other party's Confidential Information to any third party other than to the receiving party's Affiliates and its and their employees and contractors who require access for purposes consistent with this CSA and who are bound by confidentiality obligations that are at least as protective of the Confidential Information as the terms set forth herein. In addition, each party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information in any legal proceeding or to a governmental body as required by Law; provided that, to the extent legally permitted, the receiving party provides the disclosing party with prior written notice and cooperates in any effort to seek confidential treatment of any such Confidential Information.</span>

- 11.2. <span>Each party, as the receiving party, acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the receiving party, the disclosing party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</span>

- 11.3. <span>The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 11 shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of the disclosing party's disclosure of the Confidential Information to the receiving party; provided, however, that PingCAP will protect the confidentiality of Your Content stored in the TiDB Cloud Services for as long as such data remains in the TiDB Cloud Services or otherwise in PingCAP's possession or control.</span>
