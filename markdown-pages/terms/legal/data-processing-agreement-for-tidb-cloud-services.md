</div>

## 6. Sub-Processing

You shall provide a general authorization for PingCAP to appoint [sub-Processors](/legal/sub-processors-and-affiliates-for-tidb-cloud-services) to assist it with the provision of the Services, provided that PingCAP:

<div class="customize-indentation">

- 6.1 <span>ensures that the terms on which it appoints such sub-Processors comply with applicable Data Protection Laws and are consistent with the obligations imposed on PingCAP in this <ins>DPA</ins>; and</span>

- 6.2 <span>gives you reasonable prior notice to the email account registered by you in TiDB Cloud by directing you to the updated list of sub-Processors available on PingCAP's website of any intended changes concerning the addition or the replacement of any such sub-Processors. If within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice, you notify PingCAP in writing of any objections (on reasonable grounds associated with data protection considerations) to the proposed appointment, (a) PingCAP shall use reasonable efforts to make available a commercially reasonable change in the provision of the TiDB Cloud Services which avoids the use of that proposed sub-Processor, and (b) where no commercially reasonable change is available, either party may by written notice to the other party with immediate effect terminate the CSA to the extent that it relates to the affected TiDB Cloud Services. In the absence of any written notification from you in relation to the proposed appointment, such appointment would be deemed agreed by you.</span>

</div>

For the avoidance of doubt, Section 6.1 constitutes your general consent for PingCAP’s engagement of onward sub-Processors under the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in the Schedule.

For any transfer by you of CSA Personal Data from the United Kingdom, Switzerland and/or the European Economic Area (collectively, "Restricted Counties") to PingCAP in a country which does not ensure an adequate level of protection (within the meaning of and to the extent governed by the Data Protection Laws of the Restricted Countries) as required to perform the TiDB Cloud Services, such transfer shall be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in the Schedule. PingCAP agrees to abide by, and Process CSA Personal Data from the Restricted Counties in compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in the Schedule which are incorporated into this DPA, and for these purposes PingCAP shall be the "data importer" and you are the "data exporter" under the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in the Schedule (notwithstanding that you may be an entity located outside of the Restricted Countries).

## 8. Your Audit Rights

No more than on one (1) occasion in any calendar year, on prior written reasonable notice, PingCAP shall make available to you all necessary information to demonstrate PingCAP’s compliance with its obligations under this DPA, and allow for audits, including inspections, by you (or another auditor mandated by you, provided that such auditor enters into a non-disclosure agreement with PingCAP on terms acceptable to PingCAP) for this purpose, provided that any such audit takes place during normal business hours and does not result in interference with (a) PingCAP’s operations and services, and (b) with the confidentiality or security of the data of PingCAP’s other customers. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise of audit rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in the Schedule shall be as described in this Section 8.
