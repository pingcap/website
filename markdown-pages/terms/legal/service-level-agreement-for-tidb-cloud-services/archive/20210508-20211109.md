# Service Level Agreement for TiDB Cloud Services

**Last updated on May 8, 2021**

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) applies only to TiDB Cloud Services production clusters.

**1. Definitions**

<div class="customize-indentation">

- 1.1 <span>**"Month"** refers to the calendar month.</span>

- 1.2 <span>**"Monthly Uptime Percentage"** is calculated per TiDB Cloud cluster on a monthly basis and is calculated as: (Total Minutes in Month - Unavailable Minutes in Month) รท Total Minutes in Month ร 100%.</span>

- 1.3 <span>**"Unavailable Minutes in Month"** is the total number of minutes that a single TiDB Cloud cluster is unavailable in a monthly billing cycle. If all attempts to establish connections to the cluster fail within one (1) minute, the minute is considered unavailable. A TiDB Cloud cluster deployed in part of the month is assumed to be 100% available during the undeployed part of the month.</span>

- 1.4 <span>**"Monthly Service Fee"** means the total fee you paid for a particular TiDB Cloud cluster in the month.</span>

- 1.5 <span>**"Service Credit"** is the percentage of the monthly service fee to be credited to you if PingCAP approves your claim.</span>

<div class="customize-indentation">

- 3.1 <span>If PingCAP does not achieve and maintain the Monthly Uptime Percentages, then you may be eligible for a service credit as described below.</span>

<ul class="customize-indentation">

- | Monthly Uptime Percentage                      | Service Credit |
  | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
  | Less than 99% but equal to or greater than 95% | 10%            |

</ul>

</div>

**4. Credit Request**

<div class="customize-indentation">

- 4.1 <span>To receive a service credit, you must submit a claim by submitting a Credit Request through the TiDB Cloud Support Center.

<ul class="customize-indentation">

- 4.1.2. <span>Downtime and duration;</span>

- 4.1.3. <span>Descriptions of your attempts to resolve the downtime at the time of occurrence.</span>

</ul>

- 4.2 <span>If PingCAP confirms that the Monthly Uptime Percentage is less than the service commitment, PingCAP will issue the Service Credit to you within one (1) billing cycle following the month in which the request occurred. If the submission is overdue, or you fail to provide the necessary information, you will lose your eligibility for the Service Credits. Service Credits must not be transferred or used in any other account.</span>
